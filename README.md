# CHIP-8 emulator

As a learning project, I decided to write an emulator in Go. It seems like CHIP-8
is generally agreed to be the easiest starting point, so I started there.

## Usage

Right now, the emulator is not functional (unless your ROM just clears the screen
repeatedly).

When it's functional, you might be interested in the CHIP-8 program pack, which
can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20130903155600/http://chip8.com/?page=109
